# Exercise 3.1 - Sphere

In this assignment, you will write functions to find measurements about spheres.

## Requirements

Write the following functions that have to do with spheres.  The following formulas will be needed.

![Sphere Formulas](https://mrdevet.github.io/ICS3C/assets/images/sphere.png)

### Surface Area Function

Define the function `calculate_surface_area` that takes the radius of a sphere as an argument and returns the surface area of the sphere.

NOTE: Your function should not round the surface area at all.

**Sample Console**

```
> calculate_surface_area(10)
1256.6370614359173
> calculate_surface_area(5.2)
339.79466141227203
```

### Volume Function

Define the function `calculate_volume` that takes the radius of a sphere as an argument and returns the volume of the sphere.

NOTE: Your function should not round the volume at all.

**Sample Console**

```
> calculate_volume(10)
4188.790204786391
> calculate_volume(5.2)
588.9774131146049
```

## Submitting

When you are finished, push your code to GitHub.  Submit it on [Gradescope](gradescope.com) where it will be graded:
